Use data from January â€”Â March 2019 to train. Use data from April 2019 to test.\n","- [ ] Do one-hot encoding of categorical features.\n","- [ ] Do feature selection with `SelectKBest`.\n","- [ ] Fit a ridge regression model with multiple features. Use the `normalize=True` parameter (or do [feature scaling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) beforehand â€”Â use the scaler's `fit_transform` method with the train set, and the scaler's `transform` method with the test set)\n","- [ ] Get mean absolute error for the test set.\n","- [ ] As always, commit your notebook to your fork of the GitHub repo.\n","\n","The [NYC Department of Finance](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page) has a glossary of property sales terms and NYC Building Class Code Descriptions.
